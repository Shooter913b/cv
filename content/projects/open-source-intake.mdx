## Project Overview

The Open Source Intake represents a culmination of three seasons of FTC experience and mechanical design iteration. Built specifically for the 2024-25 "Into the Deep" season, this intake system prioritizes modularity, manufacturability, and performance.

## Design Philosophy

### Modularity First

The entire system is built around standardized mounting interfaces and swappable components. Teams can:

- Adjust roller configurations for different game elements
- Swap between active and passive intake modes
- Modify mounting points for various chassis designs
- Scale the system up or down based on robot size constraints

### Manufacturing Accessibility

Every component was designed with common FTC fabrication methods in mind:

- 3D printable components use standard PLA/PETG materials
- CNC parts designed for basic 3-axis mills
- Hardware uses readily available FTC-legal fasteners
- Assembly requires only basic hand tools

## Technical Specifications

### Performance Metrics

- **Intake Rate**: 3 second cycle times
- **Reliability**: 85+% success rate in testing
- **Weight**: Light weight materials and pocketing
- **Fast**: 1000+ rpm free speed

### Key Components

1. **Roller Assembly**: Compliant TPU rollers with precision bearings
2. **Drive System**: 2:1 gear reduction for optimal torque/speed
3. **Mounting System**: Universal bolt pattern compatible with common chassis
4. **Control Interface**: Standardized connector for easy integration

### Materials Engineering

Component selection balanced performance with accessibility:

- **Rollers**: Shore 85A TPU for compliance
- **Bearings**: goBilda bearings for accessibility
- **Frame**: 6061-T6 aluminum for strength-to-weight
- **Hardware**: 10.9 Alloy Steel for longevity

## Development Process

### Iterative Design

The project went through 6 major design iterations:

- **v1-2**: Proof of concept, basic functionality
- **v3-4**: Reliability improvements, bearing upgrades
- **v5**: Manufacturability focus, cost reduction
- **v6**: Final optimization based on community feedback

### Community Integration

From day one, the project was developed with community input:

- Monthly design reviews with many local and global teams
- Open feedback system through Discord collaboration
- Live CAD sessions streamed for educational value

## Impact & Adoption

### Competitive Success

Teams using the Open Source Intake achieved:

- Higher qualification rankings
- Increased reliability scores
- Reduced build time (40+ hours saved vs custom designs)
- Better documentation and team understanding

### Community Growth

The project fostered broader FTC community engagement:

- 500+ members in dedicated Discord server
- Monthly design challenges and improvements
- Mentorship connections between veteran and rookie teams
- Cross-pollination of ideas between different design approaches

## Looking Forward

### Season Extensions

The modular architecture enables rapid adaptation for future seasons:

- Roller profiles can be swapped for different game elements
- Mounting interfaces accept new sensor packages
- Control logic easily modified for rule changes

### Educational Impact

Beyond competition, the project serves as an educational platform:

- Complete design rationale documentation
- Manufacturing tutorials and troubleshooting guides
- Open collaboration model for other projects
- Bridge between veteran expertise and rookie enthusiasm

The Open Source Intake demonstrates that high-performance robotics components can be both accessible and educational, fostering innovation while building community connections that extend far beyond any single competitive season.
