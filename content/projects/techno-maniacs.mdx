## Robot Design Philosophy

### 2024 Robot: Custom Engineering

Our 2024 robot focused on **purpose-built** components as a core design principle:

- **Compact**: By designing every part specifically, an extremely compact size of 300mm squared was possible
- **Resistance**: Electrical and structure were able to withstand non-stop abuse without any problems
- **Modularity**: Building on modularity from last year, custom solutions made modularity even more pronounced
- **Repairabilty**: With custom wires and parts, repairs were built into the design for simple fixes

### 2023 Robot: Modular Innovation

Our 2023 robot focused on **modularity** as a core design principle:

- **Quick Serviceability**: Most parts removable with 4 or fewer screws
- **Field Repairs**: Designed for rapid maintenance during competition
- **Upgrade Flexibility**: Modular components allow for iterative improvements
- **Reliability**: Robust design tested across multiple tournament environments

### Technical Approach

- **Precision Engineering**: CAD-driven design with tight tolerances
- **Control Systems**: Advanced autonomous programming and teleop optimization
- **Material Selection**: Strategic use of 3D printing, CNC machining, and off-the-shelf components
