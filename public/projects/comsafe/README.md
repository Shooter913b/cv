# ComSafe Project Assets

This directory contains placeholder references for ComSafe project images:

- `hero.png` - Main project hero image showing the neighborhood map interface
- `dashboard.png` - Screenshot of the user dashboard and community feed
- `map-view.png` - Interactive map view with pins and community posts  
- `alerts.png` - Emergency alert system and safety notifications

Since actual screenshots aren't provided, the project detail page will render a stylized placeholder with neighborhood map graphics and pin icons matching the project's community-focused theme.

The placeholder includes:
- Blueprint grid overlay matching the site's technical aesthetic
- Stylized neighborhood map with street grid
- Location pins in neon blue and accent green
- "Interactive Demo Available" messaging

This maintains visual consistency with the portfolio's dark theme and neon accents while representing the geographic and community aspects of the ComSafe platform.
